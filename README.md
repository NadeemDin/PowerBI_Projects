<h2>1. PowerBI_Sales_Data_Modelling_&_Visualisation.</h2> 
<p>In this project, I created a comprehensive data visualisation solution for the Adventureworks dataset using Power BI.
I started by importing various data sets in CSV format, including sales data, customer data, return data, territory data, and calendar data. I then cleaned and formatted the data, and created relationships between the different data sets to ensure that the visualizations accurately reflected the relationships between the different data points.

Next, I created three dashboards filled with visualizations that allowed users to filter and drill through the data by various criteria. These visualizations included bar charts, line graphs, and a tree diagram, and I used them to represent the data in a clear and effective way.

Throughout this project, I gained valuable skills in data import and preparation, data analysis, and data visualisation. I was able to successfully turn raw data into actionable insights, and I am confident that my work will help the client better understand their business performance and make informed decisions. </p>

The visualizations/dashboards can be used to gain various insights into the original datasets, insights such as but not limited to:
- Specific product performance.
- Revenue/profit by territory.
- Customer detail insights.
- Potential forecasts for future sales.
- Returns vs Sales
