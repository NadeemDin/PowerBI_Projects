<h2>1. PowerBI_Sales_Data_Modelling_&_Visualisation.</h2> 
<p>This project displays my ability to take various datasets (Customer, Product, Sales, Territory etc) and create various visual data models which can be used to indicate and analyse KPIs. </p>

The visualizations/dashboards can be used to gain various insights into the original datasets, insights such as but not limited to:
- Specific product perfomance.
- Revenue/profit by territory.
- Customer detail insights.
- Potential forecasts for future sales.
- Returns vs Sales 

This Github Repository contains:
- The PowerBI .pbix file.
- A .pdf of the PowerBI dashboards.
- The original source/raw data.
